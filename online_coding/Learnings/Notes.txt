Things to remember:
----------------------

1. Do not use public with the class name if using some custom class name. On code submission compilation error occurs. 

Main.java:10: error: class Codechef_TEST is public, should be declared in a file named Codechef_TEST.java
public class Codechef_TEST 
       ^
1 error

However, you can use public with the class name if you name the class as "Main"
